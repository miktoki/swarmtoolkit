=============

`swarmtoolkit` is a toolbox intended to provide simple and quick access to
the Swarm L1 and L2 products for Python3. 

Main features:
    - reading and introspection of CDF (Common Data Format) files and 
      the containing parameters to `numpy.ndarray`'s, whether the CDF's
      are stored locally, within zip-files or on an ftp-server. 
    - shift parameters with respect to each other in time, both using a
      user-defined time shift and by finding a best fit within a range 
      using a minimizer. Parameters can also be aligned through 
      interpolation to be evaluated at the same time values.
    - Compute the magnetic field and its derivative in the NEC frame 
      from SHC ascii files.
    - Convenience functions to visualize plots using `matplotlib` and 
      `mpl_toolkits.basemap`.

        
The demo notebook, found under the demo directory gives some instructional 
examples on how this package may be used, and is a good way to quickly get
started. The documentation provides a more comprehensive look at the features.


Documentation shown below may also be found for each function:
    -  by using the ``help`` function:

        >>> help(swarmtoolkit.getCDFparams)

    -  in `ipython` shell by typing ``?`` after the object:
    
        >>> swarmtoolkit.getCDFparams?
        
For ease of use, the abbreviation ``st`` is suggested for `swarmtoolkit`:

    >>> import swarmtoolkit as st
    >>> st.plot([0,1,2],[2,1,0])
